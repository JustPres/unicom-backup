Phase 0 — Project Setup and Baseline
- Requirements:
  - Initialize Next.js 14 (App Router) project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Add Shadcn/Radix UI primitives and base UI components under `components/ui/`.
  - Establish authentication context (`lib/auth.tsx`) with localStorage persistence and role support (customer/admin).
  - Scaffold core pages and routes:
    - Visitor pages: Home (`app/page.tsx`), Catalog (`app/catalog/page.tsx`), Services (`app/services/page.tsx`), Support (`app/support/page.tsx`), About (`app/about/page.tsx`).
    - Customer: Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`), Customer Home (`app/customer/home/page.tsx`), Quotes (`app/customer/quotes/`).
    - API routes scaffold: `app/api/*` (auth, quotes).
  - Configure build tooling (PostCSS, Tailwind, tsconfig, next.config.mjs) and package manager (pnpm).
  - Set up Vercel project and initial production deployment.


Phase 1 — Navigation and Profile Menu Fixes
- Requirements:
  - Fix customer profile dropdown (Dashboard/Logout not appearing) in `components/navigation.tsx`.
    - Correct JSX structure, z-index, spacing, focus outlines, and event handling.
    - Ensure nullable user data access is safe (e.g., `user?.name`).
  - Clean mobile menu JSX to remove duplicate/broken blocks.
  - Verify `components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` props usage (side, align, sideOffset) for correct positioning.
  - Deploy to production and verify dropdown works.


Phase 2 — Customer UX Adjustments to Navigation
- Requirements:
  - Add “Dashboard” to customer main navigation (after “Support”).
  - Remove “Dashboard” and “Log out” from the customer profile dropdown; keep only “Profile”.
  - Move “Log out” for customers to the dashboard page (subtle button) to reduce visibility.
  - Ensure Dashboard link points to `/dashboard` (not `/customer/home`).
  - Implement active-link highlighting in `components/navigation.tsx` using `usePathname` for desktop and mobile nav.
  - Special-case: highlight Dashboard when on `/customer/home` to emphasize post-login state.
  - Deploy and verify.


Phase 3 — Dashboard Layout and Navbar Behavior
- Requirements:
  - Remove “Quick Actions” section from Customer Dashboard.
  - Center the navbar for Dashboard view via `Navigation` prop: `centered` (hides logo/auth on that page, centers links).
  - Replace top-right avatar for customers with non-clickable “Welcome, [name]” text; keep admin dropdown unchanged.
  - Ensure customer dashboard includes a subtle logout button at the bottom (uses `useAuth().logout`).
  - Fix any JSX lint/balance issues in `components/navigation.tsx` and restore the mobile sheet where needed.
  - Deploy and verify.


Phase 4 — Chatbot Revamp (Local Intents + UI)
- Requirements:
  - Redesign `components/chatbot.tsx` to a right-side drawer (Sheet) with:
    - Larger responsive panel; better message bubbles with timestamps.
    - Typing indicator; quick suggestion chips; multiline input (Enter to send, Shift+Enter newline).
    - Quick links under input (Catalog, Get Quote, Support).
  - Implement local intent handling (no external LLM):
    - Navigation intents: dashboard, catalog, quote, my quotes, support.
    - Product lookup intents: “search <term>” / “find <term>” using `lib/products.ts::searchProducts`.
  - Add simple FAQ knowledge base:
    - Create `lib/faq.ts` with keyword matcher `getFaqAnswer(query)`; integrate into chatbot fallback flow.
  - Render product search results as mini cards in chat (name, brand, stock; link to Catalog).
  - Persist chat history via localStorage and restore on reload.
  - Deploy and verify.


Phase 5 — Visitor Navbar Standardization and UX Polishing
- Requirements:
  - Create `components/visitor-header.tsx` (Client Component) replicating homepage header style.
    - Include links: Home, Catalog, Services, Support, About.
    - Use `usePathname` to highlight active link (green) and preserve hover behavior.
  - Apply `VisitorHeader` to visitor pages:
    - Catalog (`app/catalog/page.tsx`), Services (`app/services/page.tsx`), Support (`app/support/page.tsx`), About (`app/about/page.tsx`).
    - Mark `visitor-header.tsx` with "use client" to support `usePathname`.
  - Update homepage header (`app/page.tsx`):
    - Add “Home” link; keep font sizes consistent with other pages (`text-sm`).
    - Highlight “Home” on `/`.
  - Confirm consistent navbar across all visitor pages; ensure no font-size regression.
  - Deploy and verify production.


Notes & Next Candidates (Post-Phase 5)
- Optional:
  - Add hamburger mobile menu to `VisitorHeader` (Sheet) mirroring authenticated nav.
  - Seed sample products in `lib/products.ts` to showcase catalog/search/compare flows.
  - Add “Clear chat” button to chatbot to reset localStorage.
  - Connect real database (MongoDB/Vercel KV/Postgres) and wire quotes/products APIs.
  - Enable Vercel Analytics and basic uptime monitoring.
